      /* (When you make changes on original values of them, they wont be updated) */


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Gia', 'Puri', 'The Calmon', 'Pao'];
    

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    console.log(players,team)
    // ['Gia', 'Puri', 'The Calmon', 'Pao'];

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Lux'; 
    /* following prior logic, we'll expect to have 
    console.log(players) 
    //['Gia', 'Puri', 'The Calmon', 'Pao']; 
    but it IS updated, and we get instead:
    //['Gia', 'Puri', 'The Calmon', 'Pao']; */

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    //Now team2 will hold the original array
    
    

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Lola';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players)



    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Gia Castello',
      age: 26
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const seiren = person;
    seiren.number = 90;


    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const seiren2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 90 });
    console.log(seiren2);
    // {name: "Gia Castello", age: 26, number: 90}


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    //const seiren3 = {...person};


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

        const gia = {
          name: 'Gia',
          age: 100,
          social: {
